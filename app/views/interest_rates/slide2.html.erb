  <h2>Time Value of Money</h2>
  <p>
    Let me start by asking you a simple question.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Which would you prefer?</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    <button class="button" id="aDollarToday">A Dollar Today</button>
    <button class="button" id="aDollarTomorrow">A Dollar Tomorrow</button>
  </p>

  <p>
    Time Value of Money is the idea that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the tommorow. This is because that dollar received today can earn <strong>INTEREST</strong> up until it is used. Having money for any given length is time is valuable. 
  </p>


  <p>
    <strong>Now it's time to think. Which would you prefer?</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    <button class="button" id="20today">$20 Today</button>
    <button class="button" id="25twoWeeks">$25 in Two Weeks</button>
  </p>

  <p>
    The correct answer is $25 in two weeks.
